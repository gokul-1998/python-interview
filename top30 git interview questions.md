- git merge vs git rebase?
    - to incorporate new commits into your feature branch , use merge
    - create an extra merge commit everytime we merge
    - `rebase` incorporates all the new commit in the master branch
    - rewrite the projrct hostory by creating brand new commit for each commit in the original branch

- how to add files to previous commit?
    - `git commit --amend` helps to combine the stages changes with previous commits instead of creating an entirely new commit

- How is git remote diff from git clone?
    - git remote 
        - enables to create, view and delete connections to remote repos
- git stash drop?

    - `git log` or `git log <branch>`
    - `git log --oneline`
        - to get logs oneline at a time
- `git remote -v` - will give what remote we are refering to

        - in a folder .ssh in home directory
        - go to settings, gor to ssh gpg keys, we can add new ssh by copying from the file

- difference between merge and rebase <h1>important</h1>
    - in merge, the new changes will be at the top
    - in rebase - the changes will be at the bottom
        - all changes will come in linear way
